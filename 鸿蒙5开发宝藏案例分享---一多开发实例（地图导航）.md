### 🌟 HarmonyOS Development Hidden Treasures Unveiled! Hands-On Guide to Mastering "One-Develop-Multi-Deploy" Map Navigation Cases 🌟  

Hello everyone! I'm your old friend, here to uncover the "well-hidden" practical cases in HarmonyOS official documentation! While working on a HarmonyOS project recently, I accidentally discovered this "one-develop-multi-deploy" example for map navigation—it was like discovering a new continent! Let me take you through this ultra-practical development template in an immersive experience~  

💡 Key points up front: This case perfectly demonstrates how to adapt to multiple devices like phones/foldables/tablets with a single codebase. Let's dive into the core insights!  


### I. What Makes This Case Outstanding?  
The official team uses a map navigation app as a model to showcase four core scenarios:  
1. **Homepage intelligent panel**: Bottom panel on mobile, auto-switches to sidebar when foldable is unfolded  
2. **Route planning page**: Layout adapts dynamically while sliding the panel  
3. **Service cards**: 2×4 grid static cards compatible with all devices  
4. **Live view**: Dual display in capsule and card forms  

The most impressive part: All effects are implemented with the ArkUI framework, fully adhering to the "develop once, deploy everywhere" principle!  


### II. Mind-Blowing Tricks That Made Me Exclaim  
#### 🚀 Three-Stage Metamorphosis of the Home Panel (Code Snippet)  
```typescript  
// Gesture control for panel height changes  
.gesture(  
  PanGesture(this.panOptionHeight)  
  .onActionUpdate((event?: GestureEvent) => {  
    // Calculate panel height in real time  
    let height = this.columnHeight - event.offsetY;  
    this.tempColumnHeight = height < Common.HEIGHT_LOW  
      ? Common.HEIGHT_LOW  
      : (height > this.columnMaxHeight ? this.columnMaxHeight : height);  
  })  
  .onActionEnd(() => {  
    // Auto-snap to the nearest gear  
    if(this.tempColumnHeight > ThresholdA) this.columnHeight = HighGear;  
    else if(this.tempColumnHeight < ThresholdB) this.columnHeight = LowGear;  
    else this.columnHeight = MidGear;  
  })  
)  
```  
**Effect comparison**:  
- Portrait mobile → Fixed bottom height  
- Unfolded foldable → Floating sidebar panel  
- Landscape tablet → Draggable position adjustment  

#### 🛠️ Service Card Development Tips  
When creating 2×4 grid cards, the official team used this god-tier configuration:  
```typescript  
ForEach(FormViewData.FUNCTIONS, (item) => {  
  Column() {  
    Image(item.icon)  
      .width($r('app.float.list_image_size'))  
    Text(item.desc)  
      .fontSize($r('app.float.list_desc_font_size'))  
  }  
})  
```  
Combined with resource files, it achieves multi-device size adaptation—no more manual media queries!  


### III. Must-Read Pitfall Prevention Guide for Newcomers  
1. **Thorough breakpoint listening**:  
Handle different device sizes via the `GridContainer.onBreakpointChange` event.  

2. **Gesture conflict solution**:  
Set `.simultaneousGesture` for map scrolling and panel dragging to avoid conflicts.  

3. **Dual forms for live views**:  
Register both `liveView` and `capsule` forms to cover all scenarios.  


### V. Usage Guide  
1. Search for "one-develop-multi-deploy example" in official documentation.  
2. Download the complete Demo project (includes 6 device preview modes).  
3. Focus on learning the `map` and `liveview` modules.  
4. Modify size resources in the `resource` directory for customization.  


### 👋 Final Thoughts from the Heart  
HarmonyOS's official case library reveals more gems the deeper you dig!
